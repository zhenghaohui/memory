# Memory

A small tool help you to easily architect this beautiful world ;)

## Stop rote learning from now on :)

It is hard for us to remember so many things for our head, but we always force ourselves to do it in the past. Just
remember, your head is just a CPU with a high speed cache system but not a hard disk. You will open the door towards the
new era after aware of this idea and admit it.
